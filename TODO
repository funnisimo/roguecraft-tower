General:
  [] Emeralds (for score & eventually shops)
  [] How does time convert to turn based? 1s = 200 speed?
  [X] Add regeneration status to sidebar - how? on/off? {Regen}
  [] Add temporary speedup to sidebar - how? on/off? {Fast}
  [] Can sidebar do mouseover for items? Mouseover {Regen} gives details - maybe even from multiple sources.
  [] Charged Shot for bows - 'F' vs 'f'
    [] Charge then target
    [] Can cancel at targeting
    [] Is charge time configurable?

    
Levels:

Player:
  Inventory:
    [X] Melee

Items:
  [X] Tags

  [X] Press 'p' to activate?
  [X] Potion cooldown - 40s (8000 time units?)
  [X] Add potion status to sidebar
  [] Update potion reset length - seems too short now
  [] Make Potion more generic 
    - No numbers in the player class (use data)
    - logic contained in a separate file (use events)
