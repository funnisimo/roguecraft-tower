General:
  [] Emeralds (for score & eventually shops)
  [] How does time convert to turn based? 1s = 200 speed?
  [X] Add regeneration status to sidebar - how? on/off? {Regen}
  [] Add temporary speedup to sidebar - how? on/off? {Fast}
  [] Can sidebar do mouseover for items? Mouseover {Regen} gives details - maybe even from multiple sources.
  Charged Shot for bows - 'F' vs 'f':
    [] Charge then target
    [] Can cancel at targeting
    [] Is charge time configurable?
  GameOpts:
    [] - { tile: { kinds: {...}}}
    [] - { horde: { kinds: {...}}}
  [] APP.factory => { item, actor, ... }
  [] Game.create => { actor, item, ... }
  [] Game.install => { actorKind, itemKind, ... }
  [] Level.add => { actor, item, ... }
  [] Look into Phaser plugins to add object types - how does it work?  Can/should this be in there?
  [] When an Obj is spawned into the FOV, interrupt the Hero travelling
  [] When an Obj becomes visible, interrupt the Hero travelling (unless the Obj is marked as IGNORE_WHEN_SEEN)
    - Allow marking object with a key - which key?  
    
Levels:
  [X] Pick items after level creation
  [X] Ensure spawns have enough total challenge for level
  [] More variety in levels

Framework:
  [] Loop v.2
    - Level.update(dt) 
      - if this.scene.timers.length || this.scene.tweens.length || level.scene.paused.update { return }
      - let current = this.schedule.peek()
      - let done = false
      - while current && !done
        - let res = current.update(dt)
        - if res.isOk { this.schedule.pop(), this.schedule.push(current, res.time), done = isHero(current) }
        - if res.isStop() { this.schedule.pop() }
        - if res.isRetry { this.scene.needsDraw = true, done = true }
        - if res.isWait { this.scene.needsDraw = true, done = true }
        - if this.scene.timers.length || this.scene.tweens.length || level.scene.paused.update { done = true }
        - current - this.schedule.peek()
    - Level.tick
      - remove dead actors
  [] Actor v.2
    - Actor.update(dt)
      - if ! this._todo.length && this.ai
        - this._todo = this._ai.next()
      - if this._todo.length 
        - let current = this.todo[0]
        - let res = current.perform(dt)
        - if res.isOk() { this.todo.pop_front() }
        - if res.isStop() { this.todo = [] }  // Dead is really the only thing that would do this
        - return res
      - return idle(this)        
  [] Actions v.2
    - constructor(actor, ... target, settings, ...)
    - perform(dt) -> ActResult
    - willSucceed() -> boolean
    - getTargets() -> Obj[]
    - isValidTarget(obj) -> boolean
    - range() -> number
    - 
  [] Cell
    - Temp obj for actions that operate on cells
    - class Cell extends Obj
      - x, y: number
      - level: Level
      - canPerformAction
      - canResolveAction
      - getBumpAction
  [] Commands v.2
    - Commands run when the key is pressed
      - When the action is figured out...
      - actor.setTodo(new_action, ...)
    - Actor.setTodo(... actions[])
      - this.todo.forEach( a => a.interrupt() )
      - this.todo = actions
  [] ObjKind
    - performs: { [id: string]: boolean | Settings }
    - resolves: { [id: string]: boolean | Settings }
    - bump: [string | {action: string, settings: Settings }]
  [] Obj
    - These are local overrides:
      - performs: { [id: string]: boolean | Settings }
      - resolves: { [id: string]: boolean | Settings }
      - bump: [string | {action: string, settings: Settings }]
    - canPerformAction(name): boolean | Settings
      - check Obj, then ObjKind
    - canResolveAction(name): boolean | Settings
      - check Obj, then ObjKind
    - getBumpAction(actor): { action: string, settings: Settings} | null
      - check Obj, then ObjKind
  [] Level Scene
    - keypress
      - execute command right away (possibly running another scene to get input)
